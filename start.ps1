<#
  Brings up a todo-app Docker Compose stack (if not already running) and
  exposes it to the internet via an ngrok tunnel on the web container's port,
  then prints the public URL once ready. One tunnel covers the whole app,
  including /admin, in either mode:

    dev  (default) - docker-compose.yml, Vite dev server on 5173; Vite
                     proxies /api/* to the api container.
    prod (-Prod)   - docker-compose.prod.yml, nginx on 8081 serving the
                     prebuilt bundle; nginx proxies /api/* to the api
                     container (see decisions/0013). Rebuilt with --build on
                     each run, since prod has no hot reload.

  The two stacks share api/data, so this refuses to start one while the
  other is running. It also refuses while either stack of todo-app (the Go
  version of this app) is running, since both apps use the same ports.

  Unlike a plain background process, the Docker stack is this project's
  normal persistent environment (see decisions/0001, the
  docker-dev-workflow skill) - so Ctrl+C here only stops the ngrok tunnel,
  not the containers. Run the printed `docker compose ... down` separately
  to stop the stack.

  Usage:  .\start.ps1          (dev)
          .\start.ps1 -Prod    (production)
  Stop:   Ctrl+C (stops the tunnel only)
